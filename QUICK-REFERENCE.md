## Decision Workflows (One-Pagers)

### Binary Choice (2 Options)
```bash
python scripts/search.py "your decision" --plan -p "Project"
python scripts/search.py --matrix "Option A vs Option B" -c "criterion1,criterion2"
python scripts/search.py "relevant keyword" --domain biases
python scripts/search.py --journal "Decision title" -p "Project"
```
**Framework:** Pros-Cons-Fixes Analysis  
**Key Q:** Which cons are fixable vs permanent?

---

### Multi-Option Selection (3+ Options)
```bash
# 1. Get decision plan
python scripts/search.py "choosing between A, B, C for [purpose]" --plan -p "Project"

# 2. Get criteria template
python scripts/search.py "[topic]" --domain criteria

# 3. Get analysis techniques
python scripts/search.py "comparison scoring sensitivity" --domain analysis

# 4. Create matrix
python scripts/search.py --matrix "A vs B vs C" -c "c1,c2,c3,c4,c5"

# 5. Check biases
python scripts/search.py "anchoring status quo first impression" --domain biases

# 6. Group facilitation (if team)
python scripts/search.py "anonymous voting structured" --domain facilitation

# 7. Document
python scripts/search.py --journal "Chose [WINNER] because..." -p "Project"
```
**Framework:** Weighted Criteria Matrix + Sensitivity Analysis  
**Key:** Define criteria BEFORE evaluating options

---

### Resource Allocation
```bash
python scripts/search.py "allocate resources across priorities" --plan -p "Project"
python scripts/search.py "iterative allocation" --domain frameworks
python scripts/search.py "opportunity cost" --domain analysis

# Remember: Allocate 50-70% in Round 1, measure velocity, reallocate
```
**Framework:** Iterative Allocation  
**Key:** Don't allocate 100% upfront; learn before committing

---

### Problem-Solving / Debugging
```bash
# In your AI assistant with problem-solving-pro skill:
@workspace /solve [Describe problem, environment, what you've tried]

# The skill guides you through:
# 1. Problem decomposition (break into layers)
# 2. Hypothesis ranking (by likelihood)
# 3. Evidence collection (specific tests)
# 4. Root cause (5 Whys)
# 5. Solution options (quick vs proper vs architectural)
# 6. Prevention (monitoring, alerts)
```
**Key:** Test hypotheses by likelihood × ease of testing

---

## Domain-Specific Searches

```bash
# Get decision-making frameworks (10 available)
python scripts/search.py "keywords" --domain frameworks

# Get decision type classifications (8 types)
python scripts/search.py "keywords" --domain types

# Get cognitive biases (12 with remedies)
python scripts/search.py "keywords" --domain biases

# Get analysis techniques (10 methods)
python scripts/search.py "keywords" --domain analysis

# Get evaluation criteria (8 templates)
python scripts/search.py "keywords" --domain criteria

# Get group facilitation techniques (8 methods)
python scripts/search.py "keywords" --domain facilitation
```

## Decision Journey

### Before Deciding
- ✅ Define problem precisely
- ✅ List all options/alternatives
- ✅ Define criteria BEFORE evaluating options
- ✅ Identify stakeholders
- ✅ Check relevant biases and apply remedies

### During Decision
- ✅ Get independent scores/estimates first
- ✅ Run sensitivity analysis (multi-option)
- ✅ Use structured group process (if team)
- ✅ Check references (vendors/hires)
- ✅ POCs for technical decisions

### After Decision
- ✅ Create journal entry with rationale
- ✅ Set review date (3-6 months or 12 months)
- ✅ Document implementation plan
- ✅ Identify known risks

### Retrospective
- ✅ Update journal with actual outcomes
- ✅ Extract lessons learned
- ✅ Improve future calibration

## High-Risk Biases (Always Watch)

| Bias | Watch For | Counter |
|------|-----------|---------|
| **Confirmation** | Noticing what supports first impression | Seek disconfirming evidence actively |
| **Anchoring** | First number/option influences rest | Independent estimates before comparing |
| **Sunk Cost** | Past investment justifying future | Evaluate as if starting fresh |
| **Overconfidence** | Too certain about uncertain outcomes | Pre-mortem, track calibration |
| **Status Quo** | Preference for current state | Reframe as opportunity cost |

### Domain-Specific
- **Hiring:** Affinity, Halo Effect, Resume-Driven
- **Tech:** Resume-Driven, Not Invented Here, Status Quo
- **Allocation:** Planning Fallacy, Overconfidence

## Pro Tips

### Decision-Making
1. **Pros-Cons-Fixes** for binary choices — Ask "is this fixable?"
2. **Sensitivity Analysis** for multi-option — What if weights change?
3. **Define Criteria First** — Prevents anchoring and post-hoc rationalization
4. **Use Anonymous Voting** — Surfaces minority views before group pressure
5. **Reference Checks** — Talk to customers/previous managers, not just sales pitch

### Problem-Solving
1. **Break Into Layers** — Decompose by system architecture
2. **Rank by Likelihood** — Test highest probability hypotheses first
3. **Measure Before Fixing** — Understand the problem before proposing solution
4. **5 Whys** — Work backward from symptom to root cause
5. **Prevention Matters** — Add monitoring to catch this in future
